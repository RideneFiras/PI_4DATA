# üî¨ Model Comparison ‚Äì QoS Prediction

This repository is dedicated to testing and evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms for predicting **network throughput (QoS)** in 5G environments. Each branch corresponds to a different approach tested by a group member.

Our aim is to assess the performance of each model using standard regression metrics and identify the most effective solution.
